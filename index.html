     <h1>My First Blog Post</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This is my first blog post. I am learning HTML and CSS at The Odin Project. It is <strong>really exciting</strong> and I am making <em>great progress</em> every day.</p>

<h2>What I Learned</h2>
<p>Today I learned about <strong>HTML elements</strong> like headings, paragraphs, and how to make text <em>bold and italic</em>. These are the basic building blocks of every webpage.</p>
<p>This is how i start my learning everyday.</p>

    <li>I continue my Odin Project</li>
</ol>
